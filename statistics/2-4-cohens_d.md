[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> QUESTION 2.4: This is a question about size effect and the difference between groups.  From the data
it appears that with weight, the second baby tends to be about (converting .125 to oz) about
2 oz heavier than the first born child.  The cohen d, measuring the difference in means is
rounded -0.09 standard deviations, which seems quite small.  This matches the findings with
length of pregnancy in that length differs by about .078 weeks so * 7 for days and * 24 for hours 
gets about a 12.5 hour difference between first and second.  The cohen d is only .0288 
standard deviations difference which is very small as well.
