[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Question 4.2 PMFs tell us the probability that a item in the distribution IS a certain value, where a CDF 
tells us the probability (of sorts, percentile really) that a value is <= a certain value.
This random number generator isn't really random - it assigns as 1/N
probabilty to each number in the distribution - in this case thinkplot.Cdf(random_nums_pmf)
shows this value.
