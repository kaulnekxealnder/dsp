[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> Question 5.1 To answer, ~34.275% of the adult male population could be in the blueman group, their
lower end range is quite a bit higher than the first stdev from the mean to the smaller
height, but about in line with the upper bound for the stdev. I guess they are technically
removing 34% of a single stdev from the mean from their population. But anyone only people 
inside one stdev of the mean can be in blueman group.
