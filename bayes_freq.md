**Bayes Theorem**: In the most simplistic form, Bayes statistics are focused on conditional probability and conjunction.  It gives you a way to update the probability of a hypothesis as you accumulate or observe new data.  P(H) and P(D|H) can both change impacting P(H|D) where P(D) is your constant.  It is ideal for the concept of modeling as it will take new impormation into account and update its hypotheses in response.

**Frequentist Comparison**: A type of statistical comparison that attempts to draw conclusions from sample data and emphasize frequencies or proportions of the data.  To me, this means that this type of comparison doesn't really allow the consideration of alternate or updated hypotheses.  The conclusions are almost pre-determined by the data, not allowing for things to influence the distribution under comparison.
